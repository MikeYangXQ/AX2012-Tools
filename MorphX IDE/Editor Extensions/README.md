# AX2012 Tools - MorphX IDE - Editor Extensions

This is where AOT tools, code editor extensions and any other development tools related to AOT and MorphX go.

## How to install the extensions

* [Downloads](http://ax2012editorext.codeplex.com/releases) the zip file with the libraries or clone the repository and build it yourself.
* Close your Dynamics AX 2012 client.
* **Unzip and copy** the libraries that you want to use to the AX client folder on disk (by default: _C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Dynamics AX\60\Client\Bin\EditorComponents_).
* You can copy all assemblies or only the ones you want to use.
* That's all!! Just open your Dynamics AX 2012 Development client and enjoy.

## Building

* This project needs to be built with **Visual Studio 2010 SDK**.
* Download it **[here]**(http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21835).

## Troubleshooting & Known issues

* Some times Extensions don't work because Windows blocks the file after downloading it from internet. [Tommy Skaue has posted in his blog a possible fix to this problem](http://yetanotherdynamicsaxblog.blogspot.com.es/2013/03/free-editor-extensions-for-ax2012.html?showComment=1363082266457#c2118124613862283410]).
